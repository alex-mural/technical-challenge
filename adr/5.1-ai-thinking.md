# ADR 5.1 â€” Implement AI thinking behavor

## Context and Problem Statement

We want to improve the user feedback for our tic-tac-toe AI. The AI should look like it is thinking hard so the users feels it is more clever than it actually is.

It needs to be asynchronous.

## Considered Options

* Stateful implementation is kept in the component state (either via a named boolean, or a javascript enum)
* Binding/Unbinding the event handler for UI interaction

## Decision Outcome

Chosen options: flag based implementation

## Iteration Path

* Decoupling the AI logic from the `Board` component would be a welcome improvement, for instance with an _Event emitter_
